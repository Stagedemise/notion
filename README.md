This is a personal project but can be used by other people if anyone wants to. 
These are a bunch of Widgets I made/customised/used for my private/personal Notion. 
Lots are from different websites and different tutorials with a bit of customisation on my end, **I do not own all of these and not all of these are my ideas**. 
Most widgets that are **not** my ideas/my creations have their original source listed in the code.
I keep experimenting with stuff. At any given time, you will see that most, if not all, of the widgets seem to not be my creations. This is just because my creations are prone to failure. That's all for now! Feel free to comment.
