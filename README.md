This is a personal project but can be used by other people if anyone wants to. 
These are a bunch of Widgets I made/customised/used for my private/personal notion. 
Lots are from different websites and different tutorials with a bit of customisation on my end, I do not own all of these and not all of these are my ideas. 
A lot of the original sources are mentioned in the code of each widget
I keep experimenting with stuff.
