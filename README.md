This is a personal project..
These are a bunch of Widgets I made/customised/used for my private/personal Notion. 
Lots are from different websites and different tutorials with a bit of customisation on my end, **I do not own all of these and not all of these are my ideas**. 
A lot of the original creators or websites state that these are for personal use only. For more information, visit the original website which can be found in the code most of the time.
Most widgets that are **not** my ideas/my creations have their original source listed in the code.
I keep experimenting with stuff. At any given time, you will see that most, if not all, of the widgets seem to *not* be my original ideas, and have only been customised by me. This is just because my creations are prone to failure.
